Research Focus
======
My research focuses on developing deep learning architectures that address the challenge of processing and understanding multimedia data—images, videos, texts, and audio. The project aims to bridge the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.

Key objectives include:
* Developing architectures that link visual entities in images and textual descriptions to knowledge databases
* Enabling semantic descriptions through ontology
* Enhancing a robot's ability to interpret and communicate its understanding of the environment
* Improving multimedia data processing and semantic understanding for better human-robot interactions

Skills
======
* Languages: French (Native), English (Proficient – IELTS 7.5), Spanish (Intermediate)
* Engineering Skills: C++, Python, Java, Matlab, GitHub, ROS, ABB Robot Studio, Creo PTC
* Interests: Basketball, Football, Psychoanalysis, Chess, Geopolitics

Professional Affiliations
======
* TRAIL Doctoral Network
* Human Inspired Technology Research Centre, University of Padova
* Department of Mathematics "Tullio Levi-Civita", University of Padova
