Education
======
* PhD in Computer Science for Societal Challenges and Innovation, Università di Padova, XXXIX series (ongoing)
  * Project: "Deep Learning-Based Architectures for Semantics Discovery of Entities and Events"
  * Funded by: HORIZON-MSCA-2021-DN-01-01, project n. 101072488
  * Supervisor: Alessandro Sperduti
  * Co-supervisor: A. Paoli

Research Focus
======
My research focuses on developing deep learning architectures that address the challenge of processing and understanding multimedia data—images, videos, texts, and audio. The project aims to bridge the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.

Key objectives include:
* Developing architectures that link visual entities in images and textual descriptions to knowledge databases
* Enabling semantic descriptions through ontology
* Enhancing a robot's ability to interpret and communicate its understanding of the environment
* Improving multimedia data processing and semantic understanding for better human-robot interactions
