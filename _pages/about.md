## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate in Computer Science for Societal Challenges and Innovation (XXXIX series) at the University of Padova, Italy. My research is funded by the HORIZON-MSCA-2021-DN-01-01 program, project n. 101072488, as part of the [TRAIL Doctoral Network](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/research/projects/trail/overview.html).

## Research Focus

My project, "Deep Learning-Based Architectures for Semantics Discovery of Entities and Events," addresses the challenge of processing and understanding multimedia data—images, videos, texts, and audio. This complexity arises from the gap between multimedia representation and machine perception of entities, their semantic meanings, and interconnected events.

The objective of my research is to develop deep learning architectures that link visual entities in images and textual descriptions (derived from audio) to knowledge databases, enabling semantic descriptions through ontology. By semantically integrating and describing entities and events across various data formats, this project aims to enhance a robot's ability to interpret and communicate its understanding of the environment.

Advancements in this field will improve multimedia data processing and semantic understanding, facilitating better human-robot interactions and automated multimedia analysis.
